# Welcome

My name is Jesus Valencia and this is a repository housing the files for my personal website
which you can check out [here](http://jesusvalentinvalencia.wordpress.com/). I hope you enjoy your stay. Feel free to look around and check out some of my other projects as well!

This site was made in VSCode using Bootstrap's [Freelancer](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer/) portfolio theme as it's base.
